Maximizing ChatGPT interaction for artificial cognitive architectures: a framework for evolving conversational excellence .
As the landscape of Language Models (LLMs) expands and with numerous versions of models such as ChatGPT available, there is a demand for a methodological framework that allows effective interactions, contextual understanding and synchronous adaptation with evolving LLMs. Particularly in the context of Artificial Cognitive Architectures such as Soar and ACT-R, leveraging ChatGPT resources to assist in the development of these architectures becomes fundamental (Langley, Laird, Rogers, 2009). Therefore, we present a proposed methodology that promotes continuous and productive interactions between users and ChatGPT, focusing on contextualization and the generation of optimized results in the domain of Artificial Cognitive Architectures (Dennett, 2013).

**1. Initiation and Setting the Context:**
To initiate interaction, users must begin their input with a specific keyword or phrase denoting the domain or topic of interest. For example, if the user wants to discuss "Soar Architecture", they can start with "About Soar..." This allows ChatGPT to establish context and adapt your responses accordingly.

**2. Multi-turn talk:**
Rather than relying on single-turn interactions (multiple requests within a single prompt), it is beneficial for the user to create a relationship based on multi-turn conversations (sequence of prompts). By maintaining context within the same channel, ChatGPT can "recall" previous exchanges, leading to coherent and contextualized responses. This approach is beneficial for developing an evolving and ongoing train of thought (Lieto, 2021).

**3. Asking clarifying questions:**
ChatGPT can be asked to ask clarifying questions when faced with ambiguous user input. These questions seek to better understand user intent and provide more accurate answers. It is positive that the user provides coherent information according to the questions, this ensures that ChatGPT produces more accurate and relevant results (Cangelosi, 2015).

**4. Meta communication and user feedback:**
It is important for the user to provide metacommunication and feedback during the conversation. By using phrases like "Was this answer helpful" or "Could you elaborate on this more", users can guide ChatGPT to generate better results. Periodic requests for user feedback can further improve model performance over time (Silva, Lima Junior, 2017).

**5. Domain Specific Training:**
Supplement ChatGPT training with domain-specific data related to Artificial Cognitive Architectures like Soar and ACT-R. This increase improves the model's understanding of the complexities and nuances of these architectures, leading to more informed and contextually appropriate responses (Baraka's, Alves-Oliveira and Ribeiro, 2020).

**6. Taking advantage of new versions of Artificial Cognitive Systems:**
As new versions of Soar and ACT-R are released, users must explicitly tell the model which version is being used at the start of the conversation. This allows ChatGPT to adapt its responses in sync with model-specific improvements and capabilities.

**7. User-focused fine-tuning:**
Consider employing fine-tuning techniques with user-generated data to tailor ChatGPT responses to users' needs. Fine-tuning conversations related to Artificial Cognitive Architectures will allow ChatGPT to better align with user preferences and generate more insightful insights.

The proposed methodology lays the groundwork for a better interaction between users and ChatGPT, particularly in the context of Artificial Cognitive Architectures such as Soar and ACT-R. By prioritizing context setting, multi-turn conversations and user feedback, the framework fosters an environment where ChatGPT features can be optimally leveraged. Additionally, incorporating domain-specific training and fine-tuning ensures that ChatGPT remains current and in tune with the evolving demands of users and the field of Artificial Cognitive Architectures. With these steps, interaction becomes a mutually beneficial process, driving the advancement of ChatGPT and cognitive architecture modeling.
